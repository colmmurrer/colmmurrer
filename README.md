Hi I'm Colm. I'm currently majoring in computer science as a junior at the University of Oregon. Focused in the front end of web development. i love playing and watching basketball, soccer, and most other sports. I'm from the east coast, and on the west in Oregon for school. Interested in working on either coast.
